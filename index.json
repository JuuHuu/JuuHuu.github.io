While compensation voltage scanning speed is a fundamental parameter in FAIMS, its impact on spectra remains unclear. In this work, a function referred to as F-EMG is introduced to describe the impact of compensation voltage scanning speed on FAIMS spectra, and the properties of the function are studied. Theoretical analysis emphasizes the impact of the scanning speed on peak height, position, and symmetry, as well as the capability of the F-EMG function to progressively approach Gaussian function at lower scanning speeds. Furthermore, the function indicates that spectra obtained in positive and negative scanning modes exhibits symmetry. An experimental validation, conducted with a custom FAIMS setup and analyzing hydrogen sulfide, ethylbenzene, toluene, styrene, benzene and ammonia, confirms the model's influence on peak features, fitting accuracy, and exhibits a closer alignment with the Gaussian function at lower scanning speeds. Additionally, the experimental data indicate that the spectra show symmetry in positive and negative scanning models. This work not only improves understanding of FAIMS spectral analysis but also introduces a robust method for enhancing data accuracy across varying scanning speeds.","tags":["FAIMS"],"title":"Theoretical and Experimental Study on the Effect of Scanning Speed on Faims Peaks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Hugo is a framework to generate statics website, and Github is to publish the website.

It’s easy to maintain and clear to read.\nPreparing Create a repository on GitHub We can upload our website to various servers though, I use GitHub to hold my personal website since it’s free. Creating a repository for personal website is slightly different from normal repository. The name for a personal website’s repository should be the same with your github name, and every one can have only one such repository. Building detail can be found on GitHub website.\nInstalling Hugo Installing Hugo is very easy on Windows platform. All you have to do is download a binary .exe file and add the file path to system variable. Installation detail can be found on hugo official website.\nChoosing a Hugo theme Upon finishing install hugo, you can chooses a theme to generate your website. The theme market can be found here. And installing process usually listed in the introduction part of the theme.\nCompile and preview Follow the theme introduction to config your website, you should already preview your website on your computer. The next step is to publish the site to GitHub. Before doing that, here are some tips:\nPreview your website using command:\nhugo server Generate the website file using:\nhugo The website file will be generated in \\public by default. For convenient, you can change it to other path by adding following line to config.yaml or hugo.toml file under hugo root space.\nAdding to config.yaml file:\npublishDir: \u0026#34;your path\u0026#34; Pushing the website to GitHub Using git or other GUI app, publishing the website file to repository you created.\nPosting the blog Posting blogs to our website needs three steps: creating, compiling and publishing.\nCreating: creating a .md file and write some content on your computer. Creating steps using following command:\nhugo new [your_post_path\\your_file.md] for example:\nhugo new .\\content\\post\\UsingHugo\\using_hugo.md the above command is that I used to write this blog.\nThen using yor editor to write contents on the .md file. Yo can also preview the file using hugo server command.\nAttention that you have to set “draft” at the top of your .md file to false. Otherwise, You will not be able to preview the blog.\nCompiling: compile the web file Noting that all you have done is on your computer. You have to compile the website for publishing. Compiling the website using hugo command.\nPublishing: publishing the website to Github Using your way to publish the website to GitHub, then everyone can see your web.\n","date":1712238524,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712238524,"objectID":"de535b8b1b67802c3741b6133995f2b8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/usinghugo/usinghugo/","publishdate":"2024-04-04T21:48:44+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/usinghugo/usinghugo/","section":"post","summary":"Hugo is a framework to generate statics website, and Github is to publish the website.

To improve the scan speed of compensating voltage (CV) in multi-cycle scanning, the challenge arises in peak position shifts. This article proposes a method to accurately determine peak positions regardless of scan speed by exploiting the symmetric features of spectra obtained through positive and negative CV scans. The proposed method enables extremely fast scan speeds. A custom-built FAIMS system was used to verify the correlation between peak shifts and scan speed, the symmetry of spectra peaks under positive and negative CV scan modes, and the peak positions and solution errors of nonlinear functions by using benzene, styrene, acetone, toluene, m-xylene, and hydrogen sulfide as experimental samples. The results demonstrate the widespread occurrence of peak shifts, with peak deviations reaching as high as 2.49% even in slow scans of 0.75 V/s. As scan speed increases, peak position deviations gradually increase, with the maximum deviation reaching 46.83% at a scan speed of 30 V/s. By applying the proposed averaging method, peak positions of the six substances were obtained within the scan speed range of 30 to 0.75 V/s. Compared to traditional methods, the maximum peak position error using the averaging method was reduced by approximately 87.5%, and the spectrum acquisition time was reduced by 85%. The use of the averaging method reduced the calculation error of the alpha function by 88% and decreased the acquisition time by 80%. The research findings of this study offer a solution for the accurate determination of peak positions in FAIMS under fast scanning.","tags":["FAIMS"],"title":"Rapid method for accurate peak position extraction in high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jun Hu","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
